# Budgetwise Web Developer Challenge

This is my submission fir the Budgetwise Web Developer Challenge. The challenge required implementing a partially functional rendition of the Budgetwise Home Page, where users can manage budgets and track spending across various categories.

## Implementation Approach
I approached this challenge as an opportunity to refresh my Vue.js skills after a 2-year gap in coding. Each element of the UI was implemented as a standalone component, though in a production environment I would have further organized these into parent/child component relationships.
The implementation focuses on:

## Aimed for precise UI replication following the provided Figma designs
Component-based architecture
Dynamic data rendering
Interactive transaction addition

✅  Full navigation bar with user profile  
✅  Budget overview with visualizations  
✅  Category listing with progress bars  
✅  Dynamic coloring for budget status (underspent/overspent)  
✅  Transaction history display  
✅  Add transaction functionality  
✅  6-month spending snapshot with data visualization  

## Tech Stack

Vue.js 3  
Tailwind  
Local development server  

## Development Challenges
Some of the key challenges faced and overcome during this project:

Ensuring pixel-perfect alignment of category items and progress bars  
Implementing the full-width navigation bar while maintaining centered content  
Reconnecting with coding best practices after a period away from coding
